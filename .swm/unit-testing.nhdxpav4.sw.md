# Overview

A test is a validated assertion run using elements of the written scripts. After a script is completed, any elements that require calculation should be tested.

* * *

# Naming Conventions

Each test name should have four sections:

*   Name of the script

*   Name of the method in the script being tested

*   Basic description of the test

*   Expected result of the test as an assertion

Each section of the test should be written using Pascal case. Each section should be separated by an underscore character.

e.g.: MyScript\_MyMethod\_AddTwoValues\_AddedValuesYieldSum

e.g.; `CommandLogic_AddMoney_ModifyValueFromString_WalletValuePlusEqualsValue`<swm-token data-swm-token=":Assets/Unit Tests/EditMode/CommandLogic_AddMoney_ModifyValueFromString_WalletValuePlusEqualsValue.cs:4:4:4:`public class CommandLogic_AddMoney_ModifyValueFromString_WalletValuePlusEqualsValue`"/>

# Testing Schedule

When a script is completed, it should be tested. Any variable requiring calculation that could impact the game should be tested.

When a unit checkpoint is reached, all tests on that checkpoint should be run - any failed tests should be addressed before moving to the next checkpoint.

When a unit is completed, all tests on that unit should be tested.

At regular intervals, a global test of the project should be completed.
