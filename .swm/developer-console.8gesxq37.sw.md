# Overview

The Developer Console is controlled by a suite of scripts that allow developers and testers to manipulate internal variables during runtime. It is comprised of three key elements - Commands, Command Compiling, and Command Interface.

<br/>

## Commands

<br/>

The heart of a command prompt.
<!-- NOTE-swimm-snippet: the lines below link your snippet to Swimm -->
### ðŸ“„ Assets/Scripts/Utilities/Console/IConsoleCommand.cs
```c#
7              IEnumerable<string> CommandWords { get; }
8              bool Process(string[] args);
```

<br/>

A layer of abstraction allows functionality to be assigned via the Inspector.
<!-- NOTE-swimm-snippet: the lines below link your snippet to Swimm -->
### ðŸ“„ Assets/Scripts/Utilities/Console/ConsoleCommand.cs
```c#
15             [SerializeField] private UnityEvent<string[]> functionField;
```

<br/>

At its core, a command is comprised of a collection of command words, and an event that is processed when called. Commands are defined as Scriptable Objects. Each command also includes its own metadata, including whether or not it prints a confirmation to the console log, syntax help, or a description of functionality.

All command logic is stored in the `CommandLogic`<swm-token data-swm-token=":Assets/Scripts/Utilities/Console/Commands/CommandLogic.cs:8:5:5:`    public class CommandLogic : MonoBehaviour`"/> class as public methods. They are assigned to the command's UnityEvent via the inspector.

**Note**: Command words may _not_ contain spaces, as these are used for parsing arguments. Consider the following standards when creating command words:

*   For command words that require multiple words, use lower camel case.

*   For changing vital internal variables including constants, use all caps snake case.

*   For changing variables related to backend processes, use kebab case.

## Command Compiling

<br/>

Processing a command from text.
<!-- NOTE-swimm-snippet: the lines below link your snippet to Swimm -->
### ðŸ“„ Assets/Scripts/Utilities/Console/DevConsole.cs
```c#
32                     if (!command.CommandWords
33                             .Where(commandWord => commandInput.Equals(commandWord, StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase))
34                             .Any(_ => command.Process(args))) 
```

<br/>

The Developer Console is a standalone class instantiated by the `DevConsoleController`<swm-token data-swm-token=":Assets/Scripts/Utilities/Console/DevConsoleController.cs:10:5:5:`    public class DevConsoleController : Singleton&lt;DevConsoleController&gt;`"/>. The controller, which exists on a GameObject in the scene, passes string input from the user to the console itself, which then parses it into a command and a set of arguments. The console then calls the `Process`<swm-token data-swm-token=":Assets/Scripts/Utilities/Console/Commands/Command.cs:9:7:7:`        public override bool Process(string[] args)`"/> command, triggering the assigned event to fire.

## Command Interface

<br/>

Adding a log to the console.
<!-- NOTE-swimm-snippet: the lines below link your snippet to Swimm -->
### ðŸ“„ Assets/Scripts/Utilities/Console/ConsoleLog.cs
```c#
15             public void AddLog(IEnumerable<string> logs)
16             {
17                 _logs.InsertRange(0, logs);
18                 
19                 CullLogs();
20                 DrawLogs();
21             }
```

<br/>

The console would not be complete without having returned values. The `AddLog`<swm-token data-swm-token=":Assets/Scripts/Utilities/Console/ConsoleLog.cs:15:5:5:`        public void AddLog(IEnumerable&lt;string&gt; logs)`"/> function allows the commands and the compiler to add log entries, giving the user relevant data about the processes they run.
