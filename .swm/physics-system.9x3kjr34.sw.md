# TODO

Create and implement the `IPhysicsInteractable`<swm-token data-swm-token=":Assets/Scripts/Physics_/IPhysicsInteractable.cs:3:5:5:`    public interface IPhysicsInteractable`"/> interface

*   Scripts that use physics will implement this instead of using a cookie cutter `PhysicsController`<swm-token data-swm-token=":Assets/Scripts/Physics_/PhysicsController.cs:6:5:5:`    public class PhysicsController : MonoBehaviour`"/>

*   Retire the `PhysicsController`<swm-token data-swm-token=":Assets/Scripts/Physics_/PhysicsController.cs:6:5:5:`    public class PhysicsController : MonoBehaviour`"/> script

*   Create a default implementation of `IPhysicsInteractable`<swm-token data-swm-token=":Assets/Scripts/Physics_/IPhysicsInteractable.cs:3:5:5:`    public interface IPhysicsInteractable`"/> to replace PhysicsController

*   Potentially create modular physics behaviors and a drag-and-drop system within the inspector to control how the object behaves in real-time via scriptable objects

Define a global constant for gravity to be cached in the physics manager on Awake

*   Have physics objects inherit gravity from the physics manager

* * *

# Overview

The Physics System is a suite of scripts that create and manage artificial gravity in the game. A custom physics system was preferred over Unity's built-in system for two main reasons:

1.  More refined control over how physics interacts with other game objects in the scene. It is much easier to create modular tools that can be repurposed for other uses later on (i,e.: `BobInPlace`<swm-token data-swm-token=":Assets/Scripts/Physics_/BobInPlace.cs:6:5:5:`    public class BobInPlace : MonoBehaviour`"/>).

2.  To the best of my knowledge, it is far easier to use a custom physics engine when working with a CharacterController component, as opposed to using both a Collider and Rigidbody component and managing them separately.

<br/>

The physics manager is pretty simple, but very effective.

### ðŸ“„ Assets/Scripts/Physics_/PhysicsManager.cs
```c#
13             public Action OnApplyPhysics;
14             
15             private void FixedUpdate() => OnApplyPhysics?.Invoke();
```

<br/>

Each object that interacts with physics has a component that is registered to the physics manager.

```c#
28             private void OnEnable()
29             {
30                 PhysicsManager.Instance.OnApplyPhysics += PhysicsBehavior;
31                 #if UNITY_EDITOR
32                 VerifyHasGroundCheck();
33                 #endif
34             }
35     
36             private void OnDisable() => PhysicsManager.Instance.OnApplyPhysics -= PhysicsBehavior;
37     
38             private void PhysicsBehavior()
39             {
40                 // as conditional behaviors are added, check for conditions before invoking methods
41                 standardBehavior.StandardBehavior?.Invoke(this, standardBehavior);
42             }
```

# The Right Tool For the Job

Creating tools that utilize custom physics is super easy. To access the physics system, a script only needs to subscribe to the `OnApplyPhysics`<swm-token data-swm-token=":Assets/Scripts/Physics_/PhysicsManager.cs:13:5:5:`        public Action OnApplyPhysics;`"/> action. From there, it's as simple as defining the behavior associated with the subscription.

## Ground Check

Each physics interactable is required to have a `GroundCheck`<swm-token data-swm-token=":Assets/Scripts/Physics_/GroundCheck.cs:5:5:5:`    public class GroundCheck : MonoBehaviour`"/> component. This component reports to the object whether or not it is grounded by checking if it is within a specified distance of the ground's collider.

The ground check at work
<!-- NOTE-swimm-snippet: the lines below link your snippet to Swimm -->
### ðŸ“„ Assets/Scripts/Physics_/GroundCheck.cs
```c#
22             public bool CheckIsGrounded() => usePoint 
23                 ? Physics.CheckSphere(checker.position, radius, layerMask) 
24                 : Physics.CheckBox(checker.position, box, transform.rotation, layerMask);
```

<br/>

## Conditions

Each physics object can respond to a variety of dynamic situations. The system is set up so that each response can be tailored to the object in question and modified easily.

Each physics object will have a default profile set up so they can function out of the box. The default behavior will mimic a solid object, such as a rock.

### Falling

### Underwater

### Impact

### Wind Force

### Water Floating

### Resting
